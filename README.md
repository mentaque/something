# Pet-project market with auth
Pet-project - shoes market with auth sending message on email for authentication, using postgreSQL, celery, redis and wrapped everything in docker containers. In this project I wanted to focus on auth and query optimization. Was used celery for sending message to user's email. There's documentation with drf-yasg.
